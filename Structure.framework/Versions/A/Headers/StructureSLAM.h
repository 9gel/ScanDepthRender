The volume is defined by its size in the real world, in meters, and is discretized into cells.
The volume resolution specifies the number of cells. As a consequence, the maximal level of detail which can be obtained by STMapper is roughly determined by volumeSizeInMeters / volumeResolution.
In short, the bigger the volume size, the higher the resolution has to be to keep the same level of details.
