/** Reference to face-vertex triangle mesh data.

Stores mesh data as a collection of vertices and faces. STMesh objects are references, and access to the underlying data should be protected by locks in case multiple threads may be accessing it.

Since OpenGL ES only supports 16 bits unsigned short for face indices, meshes larges than 65535 faces have to be split into smaller submeshes. STMesh is therefore a reference to a collection of partial meshes, each of them having less than 65k faces.

The mapper works over a fixed cuboid defining the volume of interest in the scene.
This volume can be initialized interactively using STCubePlacementInitializer.

The volume is defined by its size in the real world, in meters, and is discretized into cells.
The volume resolution specifies the number of cells. As a consequence, the maximal level of detail which can be obtained by STMapper is roughly determined by volumeSizeInMeters / volumeResolution.
In short, the bigger the volume size, the higher the resolution has to be to keep the same level of details.
